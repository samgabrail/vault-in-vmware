## Vault Upgrades

Based on HashiCorp's current guidance and security landscape, I recommend a security-driven approach rather than rigid monthly patching.

Recommended Schedule:
Critical Security Updates: Immediate (0-7 days)

Monitor for CVEs and security advisories
Recent example: CVE-2025-6000 (CVSS 9.1) required immediate patching
Regular Updates: Quarterly (every 3-4 months)

Aligns with HashiCorp's ~3 major releases per year
Maintains support coverage (HashiCorp supports current + 2 previous versions) for their Enterprise Version
Balances security with operational stability
